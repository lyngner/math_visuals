# NKANT label editor accessibility notes

The NKANT label editor now supports keyboard-only adjustments so QA can verify both pointer and keyboard paths:

- Enable **Rediger etiketter** to turn on focusable label handles.
- Select labels via the label list in the panel or by tabbing to/focusing labels directly on the SVG (focus highlights the current selection).
- Move the selected label with the arrow keys; hold **SHIFT** for 10px steps or **ALT/⌘** for fine 0.5px nudges.
- Rotate the selected label with `[` or `-` to decrease and `]` or `+`/`=` to increase (2° per press, or 10° when holding SHIFT).
- Dragging with the pointer and the **Tilbakestill** buttons continue to work alongside the keyboard shortcuts.
